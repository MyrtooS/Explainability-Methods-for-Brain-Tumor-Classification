# Explainability-Methods-for-Brain-Tumor-Classification

This is a project that produces explainable heatmaps for brain tumor classification models.

How to use this code:

Step 1: 
Download and save all the py files (libraries) because they contain the code for the Explainability Methods. 

Step 2: 
The code for the classification models is in load_image_train_models.ipynb. They are already trained and saved so you can use this to see how the models are built and trained

Step 3:
The code in  4_classes_MRI_Classification.ipynb and Binary_MRI_Classification.ipynb is the code that produces the explainable heatmaps.
