# Explainability-Methods-for-Brain-Tumor-Classification

This is a project that produces explainable heatmaps for brain tumor classification models.

How to use this code:

Step 1: 
Download and save all the py files (libraries) that contain the code for the Explainability Methods. 


Step 2: 
The code for creating and training the classification models is in load_image_train_models.ipynb. They are already trained and saved so you can use this to see how the models are built and trained.

If you run the code and train the models again you should save them and override the already trained models in order to use them to produce the explainable heatmaps.

Step 3:
The code in  4_classes_MRI_Classification.ipynb and Binary_MRI_Classification.ipynb is the code that produces the explainable heatmaps.
